## AQ Station

This project is focused on creating an application for Airport Animal Quarantine Offices to efficiently and effectively communicate with pet owners in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The Airport Animal Quarantine Offices and the pet-owners have issues communicating with each other, and due to this, there are long delays in checking out pets on the Animal Quarantine side and unnecessarily long wait times for the pet-owners. Our idea is to create an application where there could be little to no issues in communication with the AQ Offices and the pet owners with a queue functionality.

## Local Deployment

### Installation

First, install Meteor.

Second, go to the AQ-Station repository, and click the "Clone or download" button to download your new GitHub repo to your local file system. Using GitHub Desktop is a great choice if you use MacOS or Windows.

Third, cd into the app/ directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

Lastly, run the system with:

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

If all goes well, the template application will appear at http://localhost:3000.
